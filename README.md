# Machine Learning On Microcontrollers
## Project: Face segmentation on MAXIM MAX78000
This is a brief overview on the project, there is pdf of a presentation in /project folder.
As part of the course we were required to find a project and implement it on a microcontroller. Most projects on a microcontroller involve a CNN, to bring novelty but still leverage the architecture of the MAXIMM78000 I chose to implement a U-Network.
My idea was to be able to segment a face from a picture and then use the segmented face to do some other task. For example, I could use the segmented face to do face recognition or to do emotion recognition. For the training of the U-Net I used the CelebAMask-HQ Dataset.
Since the maximum input size of the network is 90Ã—91x3, I created a dataloader to make the image to be 88x88x3.

Here are a few results of the segmentation:

These are the results:
|Data-Set|Size  |IoU     |
|--------|------|--------|
|Training| 22746| 0.91390|
|Test    | 4836 | 0.88632|
